# Longfin Smelt Length at Date


## Overview

This repository contains data and code to support the development of length at date criteria for the Bay-Delta DPS of [Longfin Smelt (*Spirinchus thaleichthys*)](https://www.fws.gov/species/longfin-smelt-spirinchus-thaleichthys). These length at date criteria build on existing static length at date criteria to categorize Longfin Smelt into year class-specific age class categories. This code was used in Appendix C of the [Species Status Assessment (SSA)](https://www.fws.gov/node/4531791) for the Bay-Delta DPS of Longfin Smelt. Further development of this project may also occur.


## Installation

The code contained in this repository produced the figures and derived data that are also contained in this repository using R version 4.3.1 ("Beagle Scouts").
This repository is set up to work as an RStudio project; as such, file paths contained in the code are relative paths. This code will also work as a set of stand-alone R scripts, but the user may need to specify the locations of data files in a more explicity way.
